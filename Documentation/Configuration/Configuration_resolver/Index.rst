Configuration Resolver
======================

Generally speaking, there are different types of resolvers who crawl through a given TypoScript object and build some kind of result. The algorithm by which the result is resolved depends on the type of resolver and is very extendable. Extensions can register new resolvers of a given type, which are called and processed automatically. To register a new Resolver, we can use the methods in ``\Mediatis\Formrelay\Service\Registry``, which are registering signal slots that have to implement the interface of the resolver we want to extend. Alternatively we can use the signal slots directly.

All resolvers have in common that their constructor is fed with the configuration that has to be resolved. This can be either be a scalar value or an array.

Evaluation
##########

Interface: ``\Mediatis\Formrelay\ConfigurationResolver\Evaluation\EvaluationInterface``

Optional abstract class to extend: ``\Mediatis\Formrelay\ConfigurationResolver\Evaluation\Evaluation``

Resolvers of the type ``Evaluation`` will try to make some kind of decision. They can be used in multiple places, while their result can be processed differently depending on the context in which they are used.

Usually the Formrelay will start with the ``GeneralEvaluation`` which provides the methods ``eval`` and ``resolve``.

The method ``eval`` will process the actual logic and return a boolean value. The logic has all form fields as input variables.

::

	public function eval(array $context = [], array $keysEvaluated = []): bool;

The ``$context`` will contain the context of the current evaluation, which is at minimum the form data, which is used as input variables for the logic.

The ``$keysEvaluated`` is a list of extension keys, that have been evaluated so far. This is important for the ``GateEvaluation`` to avoid evaluation loops. Other evaluations should just pass this value to sub-evaluations, if there are any.

::

	settings.evaluateSomeEvaluation {
	  and {
	    field_a = A
	    field_b = B
	  }
	}

The method ``resolve`` will call the method ``eval`` and will return the TypoScript object path ``then`` or ``else`` depending on the result. If the corresponding object path does not exist, it will return ``null`` instead.

::

	public function resolve(array $context, array $keysEvaluated = []): mixed|null

This input of the function is the same as for ``eval``, but the result will either be one of the configuration paths ``then`` or ``else``, or ``null`` if the path is not existent.

::

	settings.resolveSomeEvaluation {
	  and {
	    field_a = A
	    field_b = B
	  }
	  then = Foo
	  else = { ... possibly more config to resolve ... }
	}

Whether ``eval`` or ``resolve`` is called depends on the context in which the evaluation is being used.
The most common context is the ``gate`` evaluation described above, where the method ``eval`` determines whether or not a destination will be triggered.

All evaluations other than ``GeneralEvaluation`` do not need to implement the method ``resolve``. They only need to take care of the method ``eval`` in order to provide a boolean result for their evaluation.

Here are all default evaluations, shipped with EXT:formrelay.

GeneralEvaluation
*****************

This evaluation is the entry point for every evaluation. It acts as an ``AndEvaluation``, but also provides the method ``resolve``.

AndEvaluation
*************

This evaluation expects a list of sub-evaluations and will process them in an and-context which means that all sub-evaluations have to evaluate to ``true`` in order for the ``AndEvaluation`` to also return ``true``. The sub-evaluations are conjunctive.

::

	and {
	  not {
	    ...
	  }
	  or {
	    ...
	  }
	  field_x = value_y
	  someEvaluation = ...
	}

Numeric keys will be thought of as encapsulated evaluations, which will start as a new ``GeneralEvaluation``.

::

	and {
	  10 {
	    ...
	  }
	  20 {
	    ...
	  }
	}

Keys that do not represent a number nor a keyword for a specific evaluation, will be recognised as field name, followed by a new evaluation. Depending on the value it will be either a ``GeneralEvaluation`` for arrays or an ``EqualsEvaluation`` for scalar values.

::

	and {
	  field_name_a = field_value_a_1
	  field_name_b = field_value_b_13
	}

::

	and {
	  field_name_a {
	    or {
	      10.equals = field_value_a_1
	      20.equals = field_value_a_2
	    }
	  }
	  field_name_b {
	    not.equals = field_value_b_13
	  }
	}

The keyword ``field`` is interpreted as new field name for all following evaluations, very much like keys that do not represent a number nor a keyword. This is helpful for field names that are actual keywords.

::

	and {
	  # the field named "and" must be equal to "foobar"
	  field = and
	  equals = foobar
	}

::

	and {
	  1 {
	    # the field named "and" must be equal to "foobar"
	    field = and
	    equals = foobar
	  }
	  2 {
	    # and the field named "not" must not be equal to "baz"
	    field = not
	    not.equals = baz
	  }
	}

EmptyEvaluation
***************

This evaluation must have a context (a field name) already. It expects a scalar value which determines whether the field value is evaluated as empty or not empty.

::

	# the field named "field_name_a" must be empty
	field_name_a {
	  empty = 1
	}

::

	# the field named "field_name_a" must not be empty
	field_name_a.empty = 0

EqualsEvaluation
****************

This evaluation must have a context (a field name) already. It expects a scalar value which is compared to the field value. In the context of a ``GeneralEvaluation`` it is used implicitly if the value of a context changing key is a scalar one.

::

	# explicit call
	field_name_a {
	  equals = field_value_a_1
	}

::

	# implicit call
	field_name_a = field_value_a_1

ExistsEvaluation
****************

This evaluation must have a context (a field name) already. It expects a scalar value which determines whether the field value is evaluated as existent or not existent.

::

	# the field named "field_name_a" must exist
	field_name_a {
	  exists = 1
	}

::

	# the field named "field_name_a" must not exist
	field_name_a.exists = 0

GateEvaluation
**************

This evaluation will load the gate configuration of the given extension (other than the one being currently evaluated) and will return its evaluation. Since Formrelay extensions can be called multiple times for one form submission (see section ``1..n``), we can tell the ``GateEvaluation`` which call shall be evaluated.

::

	gate {
	  extKey = tx_formrelay_some_other_extension
	  index = 0
	}

To see if any or all calls to one extension are triggered, we can use the keywords ``any`` or ``all`` instead of a number.

::

	gate {
	  extKey = tx_formrelay_some_other_extension
	  index = any
	}

::

	gate {
	  extKey = tx_formrelay_some_other_extension
	  index = all
	}

The shorthand to the index ``any`` is to use a scalar value for the configuration.

::

	gate = tx_formrelay_some_other_extension

We can also list (comma-separated) multiple extension which shall be evaluated together. In such a case the ``GateEvaluation`` will return ``true`` as soon as one of the extensions evaluates to ``true``.

::

	gate = tx_formrelay_some_other_extension,tx_formrelay_yet_another_extension

InEvaluation
************

This evaluation must have a context (a field name) already. It expects either an array of values or a comma-separated list of values and will check whether the form field value is within this list.

::

	field_name_a.in = field_value_a_1,field_value_a_2,field_value_a_3

::

	field_name_a.in {
	  1 = field_value_a_1
	  2 = field_value_a_2
	  3 = field_value_a_3
	}

NotEvaluation
*************

This evaluation will create a new ``GeneralEvaluation`` with its own configuration and will simply negate the result. If it is used on a scalar value, it will assume a context (a field name) and will create an ``EqualsEvaluation`` instead.

::

	not {
	  field_name_a = field_value_a_1
	  or { ... }
	  field_name_b.in = field_value_b_1,field_value_b_2
	}

::

	not.field_name_a = field_value_a_1

::

	field_name_a.not = field_value_a_1

OrEvaluation
************

This evaluation acts exactly like the ``AndEvaluation`` except that the sub-evaluations are disjunctive. As soon as one sub-evaluation is ``true``, the ``OrEvaluation`` becomes ``true``.

RequiredEvaluation
******************

This evaluation expects either an array of field names or a comma-separated list of field names. It will check whether all of them exist and contain values that do not evaluate to ``false`` (non-empty values).

::

	required = field_name_a,field_name_b

::

	required {
	  1 = field_name_a
	  2 = field_name_b
	}

FieldMapper
###########

Interface: ``\Mediatis\Formrelay\ConfigurationResolver\FieldMapper\FieldMapperInterface``

Optional abstract class to extend: ``\Mediatis\Formrelay\ConfigurationResolver\FieldMapper\FieldMapper``

Resolvers of the type ``FieldMapper`` will add processed form fields and their (processed) values into the result array. They can add, change and even delete multiple output fields which is why they get the current result passed as reference, so that they can modify it however needed.

The Formrelay will start with the ``GeneralFieldMapper`` which provides the method ``resolve``.

::

	public function resolve(array $context, array $result = []): array

All other field mappers do not have to implement the method ``resolve``. Instead they will operate in two steps: ``prepare`` and ``finish``.

::

	public function prepare(&$context, &$result);
	public function finish(&$context, &$result): bool;

The method ``prepare`` is used to change the context of the process for all field mappers that are operating on the current data.

The method ``finish`` will apply the actual changes on the result object. The return value ``true`` indicates, that the processing is complete and no further field mappers should be called for the current form field. The return value ``false`` indicates that the field mapper was not able to finish the processing of the field an the following field mappers should be called.

Here are all default field mappers, shipped with EXT:formrelay.

GeneralFieldMapper
******************

This field mapper is the entry point and provides the method ``resolve``. It is used on the settings objects ``settings.fields.mapping.<field_name>`` and ``settings.fields.unmapped``.

It is applying the method ``prepare`` on all sub-field mappers. After that it is applying the method ``finish`` on all sub-field mappers until one of them reports success (returns ``true``).

In general the ``GeneralFieldMapper`` is using the order of field mappers as they appear in the configuration, but it makes two exceptions.

The ``PlainFieldMapper`` will be applied last so that specialised field mappers can overwrite its behaviour.

The ``IfFieldMapper`` will be applied first because it shall be able to overwrite every other field mapper.

PlainFieldMapper
****************

This field mapper simply maps a form field name to an external field name.

::

	form_field_name_a = external_field_name_a

Be careful: If two form fields are mapped to the same external field (without any other mappers being involved), they will overwrite each other.

AppendKeyValueFieldMapper
*************************

This field mapper has to be combined with another field mapper, that is providing an actual mapping (like the ``PlainFieldMapper``). It will then not blindly write the form field's value into the result field but rather append it. Also, it will append the pair of field name and field value. Not just the field value.

::

	form_field_name_a = external_field_name_a
	form_field_name_a.appendKeyValue = 1

You can also configure the separators used between field name and field value as well as the separators used between different name-value-pairs.

This example shows the default values, where ``\s`` is mapped to the space character and ``\n`` is mapped to a line break character.

::

	form_field_name_a = external_field_name_a
	form_field_name_a.appendKeyValue {
	  separator = \n
	  keyValueSeparator = \s=\s
	}

AppendValueFieldMapper
**********************

This field mapper has to be combined with another field mapper, that is providing an actual mapping (like the ``PlainFieldMapper``). It will then not blindly write the form field's value into the result field but rather append it.

::

	form_field_name_a = external_field_name_a
	form_field_name_a.appendValue = 1

You can also configure the separator used between the values of different form fields (mapped to this result field).
This example shows the default value, where ``\s`` is mapped to the space character and ``\n`` is mapped to a line break character.

::

	form_field_name_a = external_field_name_a
	form_field_name_a.separator = \n

DiscreteFieldFieldMapper
************************

This field mapper has to be combined with another field mapper, that is providing an actual mapping (like ``PlainFieldMapper``). It will make sure that the result field will be a ``DiscreteMultiValueFormField`` (described above). If the result field already holds data, it will be converted into a ``DiscreteMultiValueFormField`` (if necessary) and then the field value or values are appended to it.

::

	form_field_name_a = external_field_name_a
	form_field_name_a.discreteField = 1

DistributeFieldMapper
*********************

This field mapper expects multiple external field names and will write the form field value into all those result fields.

We can configure the external fields simply as comma separated list.

::

	form_field_name_a.distribute = external_field_name_a_1,external_field_name_a_2

Or we can configure them as array.

::

	form_field_name_a.distribute {
	  1 = external_field_name_a_1
	  2 = external_field_name_a_2
	}

Having the external fields as array gives the opportunity to use sub-configurations as well.

::

	form_field_name_a.distribute {
	  1 = external_field_name_a_1
	  2 = external_field_name_a_2
	  2.appendValue = 1
	  2.negate = 1
	  3 = external_field_name_a_3
	  3.discreteField = 1
	}

IfEmptyFieldMapper
******************

This field mapper will abort the processing if the result field already contains a value.

::

	form_field_name_a = external_field_name_a
	form_field_name_a.ifEmpty = 1

.. Note:: This feature exists for legacy reasons only. It should not be used anymore, since it relies on the consistent order of the form data which can not be guaranteed. A better way to get this behaviour is to check the other input values that want to write to the same result field.

::

	form_field_name_a = external_form_field_a
	form_field_name_b = external_form_field_a
	form_field_name_b.if {
	  form_field_name_a.not.empty = 1
	  then.ignore = 1
	}

IfFieldMapper
*************

This field mapper applies a ``GeneralEvaluation`` (using its ``resolve`` method). If the result is not null (if the corresponding configuration path ``then`` or ``else`` exists) it will be used for a new ``GeneralFieldMapper`` to resolve the field mapping.

::

	form_field_name_a.if {
	  form_field_name_b = xyz
	  then = external_form_field_a_2
	  else = external_form_field_a_1
	}

If not both paths ``then`` and ``else`` exist, the ``IfFieldMapper`` may be ignored, depending on the evaluation.

::

	form_field_name_a = external_form_field_a_2
	form_field_name_a.if {
	  form_field_name_b = xyz
	  then = external_form_field_a_1
	}

All evaluations can be used, so we can create arbitrary, complex conditions.

::

	form_field_name_a = external_form_field_a_1
	form_field_name_a.if {
	  or {
	    form_field_name_b = xzy
	    form_field_name_c.not = abc
	    not {
	      or {
	        1 = and {
	          form_field_name_d = 123
	          form_field_name_e = 456
	        }
	        2 = and {
	          form_field_name_f = 789
	          form_field_name_g = 321
	        }
	      }
	    }
	  }
	  then.if {
	    or {
	      gate = tx_formrelay_foo
	      not.gate = tx_formrelay_bar
	      form_field_name_b.in = 42,666,foo
	    }
	    form_field_name_b.not = 666
	    then = external_form_field_a_2
	    then.appendKeyValue = 1
	    else.ignore = 1
	  }
	  else = external_form_field_a_999
	}

IgnoreFieldMapper
*****************

This field mapper stops the processing of the form field completely.

It can be used to ignore specific form fields explicitly.

::

	settings.fields.mapping.form_field_name_a.ignore = 1

And it can be used to implicitly ignore all fields that are not specified in the ``mapping`` object.

::

	settings.fields.unmapped.ignore = 1

It can also be used in conditioned field mappers.

::

	form_field_name_a = external_field_name_a
	form_field_name_a.if {
	  form_field_name_b = form_field_value_b
	  then.ignore = 1
	}

JoinFieldMapper
***************

This field mapper has to be combined with another field mapper, that is providing an actual mapping (like the ``PlainFieldMapper``). It will check whether the given form field value is a ``MultiValueFormField`` and will then implode the values to a single ``string``.

::

	form_field_name_a = external_field_name_a
	form_field_name_a.join = 1

We can also configure the ``glue`` of the ``implode`` call. The example below shows the default, where ``\s`` is replaced with the space character and ``\n`` is replaced with a line break character.

::

	form_field_name_a = external_field_name_a
	form_field_name_a.join = 1
	form_field_name_a.join {
	  glue = \n
	}

If we configure the ``join`` field mapper, there is actually no need anymore to explicitly enable it.

::

	form_field_name_a = external_field_name_a
	form_field_name_a.join.glue = \n

NegateFieldMapper
*****************

This field mapper has to be combined with another field mapper, that is providing an actual mapping (like the ``PlainFieldMapper``). It will evaluate the given form field value to a ``boolean`` value and return a negated version.

By default it will return ``0`` for values, that evaluate to ``true``, and ``1`` for values, that evaluate to ``false``.

::

	form_field_name_a = external_field_name_a
	form_field_name_a.negate = 1

We can also configure the negated values.

::

	form_field_name_a = external_field_name_a
	form_field_name_a.negate = 1
	form_field_name_a.negate {
	  true = foo
	  false = bar
	}

If we configure the ``negate`` field mapper, there is actually no need anymore to explicitly enable it.

::

	form_field_name_a = external_field_name_a
	form_field_name_a.negate {
	  true = foo
	  false = bar
	}

PassthroughFieldMapper
**********************

This field mapper will use the original form field name as external field name for the current destination.

::

	form_field_name_a.passthrough = 1

It is pretty much the same as an identity mapping.

::

	form_field_name_a = form_field_name_a

However, it comes in handy on the settings object ``settings.fields.unmapped`` which applies to all form fields that do not have an explicit mapping.

::

	settings.fields.unmapped.passthrough = 1

SplitFieldMapper
****************

This field mapper splits the given form field value and distributes the result among different external fields.

::

	form_field_name_a.split.fields {
	  1 = external_field_name_a_1
	  2 = external_field_name_a_2
	  3 = external_field_name_a_3
	}

We can omit the array and give a comma-separated list instead.

::

	form_field_name_a.split.fields = external_field_name_a_1,external_field_name_a_2,external_field_name_a_3

The split token is the space character by default, but it can be configured, too, where ``\s`` is replaced with the space character and ``\n`` is replaced with a line break character.

::

	form_field_name_a.split {
	  token = .
	  fields = external_field_name_a_1,external_field_name_a_2
	}

If we do not want to overwrite the split token, we can also omit the ``fields`` object.

::

	form_field_name_a.split = external_field_name_a_1,external_field_name_a_2

Example:

::

	name.split = first_name,last_name

::

	name === "Foo Bar"
	result === [first_name => "Foo", last_name => "Bar"]

If the form field value can not be split into enough parts, only the external fields that have a (split) value, will be used.

::

	name === "Foo"
	result === [first_name => "Foo"]

If the form field value can be split into more parts than external fields are configured, the last field will get all remaining (split) values.

::

	name === "Foo Bar Baz"
	result === [first_name => "Foo", last_name => "Bar Baz"]

ValueMapFieldMapper
****************

This field mapper can update the field values, by applying a ``ValueMapper`` during the field mapping.

::

	form_field_name_a = external_field_name_a
	form_field_name_a.valueMap {
	  form_field_a_value_1 = external_field_a_value_1
	  form_field_a_value_2 = external_field_a_value_2
	}

While this seems redundant because we already have a value mapping in the settings under ``settings.values.mapping``, this opens up the possibility to provide different value mappings for multiple external fields, e.g. reached via the distribute field mapper.

::

	form_field_name_a.distribute {
	  10 = external_field_name_a1
	  10.valueMap {
	    form_field_a_value_1 = external_field_a1_value_1
	    form_field_a_value_2 = external_field_a1_value_2
	  }
	  20 = external_field_name_a2
	  20.valueMap {
	    form_field_a_value_1 = external_field_a2_value_1
	    form_field_a_value_2 = external_field_a2_value_2
	  }
	}

Note: Even if a general value mapping via ``settings.values.mapping`` is provided, the value-map field mapper will use the original form field values.
This means that a field-specific value mapping is overwriting the general value mapping completely.
This is intended because the original form field values will guarantee maximum availability of information, while the general value mapping may already have reduced the information, e.g. by mapping two different form field values to the same external value.

::

	settings {
	  values.mapping {
	    form_field_name_a {
	      form_field_a_value_1 = general_external_field_a_value_1
	      form_field_a_value_2 = general_external_field_a_value_2
	    }
	  }
	  fields.mapping {
	    form_field_name_a.distribute {

	      # this mapping will work
	      # since it overwrites all mapped values of the general value mapping
	      10 = external_field_name_a1
	      10.valueMap {
	        form_field_a_value_1 = external_field_a1_value_1
	        form_field_a_value_2 = external_field_a1_value_2
	      }

	      # this mapping will NOT work
	      # since it tries to map the generally mapped values instead of the original form field values
	      # and this will actually overwrite the general mapping
	      # so the original form field values will be used
	      20 = external_field_name_a2
	      20.valueMap {
	        general_external_field_a_value_1 = external_field_a2_value_1
	        general_external_field_a_value_2 = external_field_a2_value_2
	      }

	      # this will work in principle
	      # but all unmapped fields will NOT fall back to the general mapping
	      # and instead their original form field values will be used
	      30 = external_field_name_a3
	      30.valueMap {
	        form_field_a_value_2 = external_field_a3_value_2
	      }

	      # this will work since
	      # it copies the general value mapping first
	      # and is then changing the mapping specific for this external field
	      40 = external_field_name_a4
	      40.valueMap < plugin.tx_formrelay_xyz.settings.values.mapping.form_field_name_a
	      40.valueMap {
	        form_field_a_value_2 = external_field_a4_value_2
	      }

	      # without an explicit mapping, the general mapping will be used
	      50 = external_field_name_a5
	    }
	  }
	}

The above settings will result in this behaviour:

::

	form_field_name_a === "form_field_a_value_1"
	result === [
	  external_field_name_a1 => "external_field_a1_value_1",
	  external_field_name_a2 => "form_field_a_value_1",
	  external_field_name_a3 => "form_field_a_value_1",
	  external_field_name_a4 => "general_external_field_a_value_1",
	  external_field_name_a5 => "general_external_field_a_value_1",
	]

	form_field_name_a === "form_field_a_value_2"
	result === [
	  external_field_name_a1 => "external_field_a1_value_2",
	  external_field_name_a2 => "form_field_a_value_2",

ValueMapper
###########

Interface: ``\Mediatis\Formrelay\ConfigurationResolver\ValueMapper\ValueMapperInterface``

Optional abstract class to extend: ``\Mediatis\Formrelay\ConfigurationResolver\ValueMapper\ValueMapper``

Resolvers of the type ``ValueMapper`` will map the value of a given form field to an appropriate value of the current destination.

If there is no mapping provided the original form field value is used.

The Formrelay will use the ``GeneralValueMapper`` to resolve the configuration ``settings.values.mapping.<field_name>``.

All value mappers must implement the method ``resolve``.

::

	/**
	 * @param array $context
	 * @return string|null
	 */
	public function resolve(array $context);

The parameter ``$context`` provides all necessary context data, at minimum the form data and the name of the field whose value is to be mapped.

GeneralValueMapper
******************

This value mapper processes its configuration in search for sub-value mappers that will eventually return a mapped value.

Generally speaking the configuration is processed in order of its appearance, but there are two exceptions.

The ``PlainValueMapper`` will be applied last so that specialised value mappers can overwrite its behaviour.

The ``IfValueMapper`` will be applied first because it shall be able to overwrite every other value mapper.

If a configuration key can be resolved as sub-value mapper, it will be resolved and used if its result is not ``null``. Otherwise the configuration processing will continue.

::

	settings.values.mapping.form_field_name_a {
	  keyword_a { ... sub config ... }
	  keyword_b = ... scalar config ...
	  ...
	}

If a configuration key can not be resolved as sub-value mapper, it will instead be compared to the value of the current form field. If they equal each other, its sub configuration will be used to resolve a new ``GeneralValueMapper``.

::

	settings.values.mapping.form_field_name_a {
	  form_field_value_a_1 { ... sub config ... }
	  form_field_value_a_2 = ... sub config ...
	  ...
	}

If a scalar configuration is found (processed after all other value mappers), the ``PlainValueMapper`` is used to determine the mapped value. This is actually the default use case. A simple internal-value-external-value mapping.

::

	settings.values.mapping.form_field_name_a {
	  form_field_value_a_1 = external_field_value_a_1
	  form_field_value_a_2 = external_field_value_a_2
	  ...
	}

If there is no value mapper found, that is returning a valid value (not equal to ``null``), then the original value is returned.

PlainValueMapper
****************

This value mapper is simply returning the (scalar) value it has received as configuration. It has already been described at the ``GeneralValueMapper``.

Theoretically speaking it can be applied to the field itself, though this doesn't make a lot of sense, since all values of that field would be mapped to the same value.

::

	settings.values.mapping.form_field_name_a = constant_external_value_a_for_all_internal_values

It is more common to use it for specific internal values or as result for other sub-value mappers.
::
	settings.values.mapping.form_field_name_a {
		form_field_value_a_1 = external_field_value_a_1
	}

IfValueMapper
*************

This value mapper applies a ``GeneralEvaluation`` (using its ``resolve`` method). If the result is not null (if the corresponding configuration path ``then`` or ``else`` exists) it will be used for a new ``GeneralValueMapper`` to resolve the value mapping.

If the corresponding path (``then`` or ``else``) does not exist, it will return ``null`` (as does the ``GeneralEvaluation``) and therefore will be ignored by its parent value mapper.

::

	settings.values.mapping.form_field_name_a {
	  form_field_value_a_1 = external_field_value_a_1
	  form_field_value_a_1.if {
	    form_field_name_b = form_field_value_b_1
	    then = external_field_value_a_2
	  }
	}

It can also be applied on the field itself.

::

	settings.values.mapping.form_field_name_a.if {
	  form_field_name_b = form_field_value_b_1
	  then {
	    form_field_value_a_1 = external_field_value_a_1a
	    form_field_value_a_2 = external_field_value_a_2a
	  }
	  else {
	    form_field_value_a_2 = external_field_value_a_2b
	    form_field_value_a_1 = external_field_value_a_1b
	  }
	}

Such conditions can also be nested in any order with any value mapper, that is triggering a new ``GeneralValueMapper``.

::

	settings.values.mapping.form_field_name_a.if {
	  form_field_name_b = form_field_value_b_1
	  then {
	    form_field_value_a_1 = external_field_value_a_1a
	    form_field_value_a_2 = external_field_value_a_2a
	  }
	  else {
	    form_field_value_a_2 = external_field_value_a_2b
	    form_field_value_a_1.if {
	      form_field_name_c = form_field_value_c_1
	      then.if {
	        form_field_name_d.not = form_field_value_d_1
	        not.gate = tx_formrelay_foo,tx_formrelay_bar
	        then = external_field_value_a_1b
	        else.negate = 1
	      }
	      else = external_field_value_a_1c
	    }
	  }
	}

NegateValueMapper
*****************

This value mapper will evaluate the given form field value to a ``boolean`` value and return a negated version.

By default it will return ``0`` for values, that evaluate to ``true``, and ``1`` for values, that evaluate to ``false``.

::

	settings.values.mapping.form_field_name_a {
	  negate = 1
	}

Those values can also be configured. In the example below the result will be ``no`` if the form value evaluates to ``true`` and ``yes`` if the value evaluates to ``false``.

::

	settings.values.mapping.form_field_name_a {
	  negate = 1
	  negate {
	    true = yes
	    false = no
	  }
	}

If the ``negate`` value mapper is configured, we do not need to enable it specifically.

::

	settings.values.mapping.form_field_name_a {
	  negate {
	    true = yes
	    false = no
	  }
	}

The ``negate`` value mapper triggers actually a new ``GeneralValueMapper`` which means that there can even be sub-value mappers.

As the ``GeneralValueMapper`` does, the original form value is used if no sub-value mapper exists (or no sub-value mapper returns a valid result).

::

	settings.values.mapping.form_field_name_a {
	  negate {
	    form_field_value_a_1 = 0
	    form_field_value_a_1.if {
	      form_field_name_b = form_field_value_b
	      then = 1
	    }
	  }
	}

RawValueMapper
**************

This value mapper behaves like a ``GeneralValueMapper`` except that it will not search for any keywords for sub-value mappers.

It is helpful if the form values may contain keywords of value mappers.

::

	settings.values.mapping.form_field_name_a.raw {
	    negate = some_external_value_negieren
	    if = some_external_value_for_if
	}

SwitchValueMapper
*****************

This value mapper allows field values to be TypoScript configuration values instead of configuration keys.
This is helpful for values which do not follow the rules of TypoScript keys.

The configuration of a ``switch`` value mapper is an array of cases where each has one value ``case`` which is compared to the actual form field value and one value ``value`` which is the result if the comparison succeeds.

::

	settings.values.mapping.form_field_name_a.switch {
	  10 {
	    case = form.field.value.a.1
	    value = external_field_value_a_1
	  }
	  20 {
	    case = form field \value.a 2
	    value = external_field_value_a_2
	  }
	}

The configuration value ``case`` can also be applied as scalar value of the ``switch`` object.

::

	settings.values.mapping.form_field_name_a.switch {
	  10 = form.field.value.a.1
	  10.value = external_field_value_a_1
	  20 = form field \value.a 2
	  20.value = external_field_value_a_2
	}

The ``value`` of a case is actually processed as a new ``GeneralValueMapper`` which leaves room for sub-value mappers.

::

	settings.values.mapping.form_field_name_a.switch {
	  10 = form.field.value.a.1
	  10.value = external_field_value_a_1
	  10.value.if {
	    form_field_name_b = form_field_value_b
	    then = external_field_value_a_2
	    else.negate = 1
	  }
	  20 ...
	}

ContentResolver
###############

Interface: ``\Mediatis\Formrelay\ConfigurationResolver\ContentResolver\ContentResolverInterface``

Optional abstract class to extend: ``\Mediatis\Formrelay\ConfigurationResolver\ContentResolver\ContentResolver``

Resolvers of the type ``ContentResolver`` will generate a string by parsing the given configuration as a kind of template.

EXT:formrelay will not use the content resolver itself, but other extension can use it, to process parts of the configuration. For example, a mail-formrelay can use a content resolver to insert form data into the email, e.g. as receiver, subject, mail-body.

The entry point will always be the ``GeneralContentResolver`` which provides the method ``resolve``.

::

	public function resolve(array $context): string

All other content resolvers do not need to implement this method. Instead their work is split into two steps: ``build`` and ``finish``.

::

	public function build(array &$context): string;
	public function finish(array &$context, string &$result): bool;

The method ``build`` will create the actual result, while the method ``finish`` can modify the accumulated result of all content resolvers, that are involved, afterwards. Also a content resolver can abort the finishing of all remaining content resolvers by returning the value ``true``.

GeneralContentResolver
**********************

This content resolver is just processing its configuration and reacting to everything that it finds.

A scalar configuration is triggering a ``PlainContentResolver`` which will just use the configuration itself to build the result

::

	output = This is a scalar configuration that is also the output of the content resolver.

Numeric keys will indicate sub-content resolvers, each starting as a new ``GeneralContentResolver``.

::

	output {
	  10 = This is a scalar configuration...
	  20 = in two parts.
	}
	# result === This is a scalar configuration...in two parts.

The keyword ``glue`` will be used to set a glue string that is written between the (non-empty) results of its sub-content resolvers, where ``\s`` is replaced with the space character and ``\n`` is replaced with a line break character.

The default ``glue`` is an empty string.

::

	output {
	  glue = \s
	  10 = This is a scalar configuraiton
	  20 = in two parts.
	}
	# result === This is a scalar configuration in two parts.

Any actual keyword of a sub-content resolver will trigger its ``build`` and ``finish`` methods.

::

	output{
	  field = form_field_name_a
	  trim = 1
	}

::

	output = {first_name}
	output.insertData = 1

PlainContentResolver
********************

This content resolver has already been described by the ``GeneralContentResolver`` for scalar configurations. It will simply ``build`` a result from its configuraiton.

::

	output = Hello World

FieldContentResolver
********************

This content resolver will try to find a field with the name of its configuration in the form data and will output its value.


::

	output.field = form_field_name_a

IfContentResolver
*****************

This content resolver applies a ``GeneralEvaluation`` (using its ``resolve`` method). If the result is not null (if the corresponding configuration path ``then`` or ``else`` exists) it will be used for a new ``GeneralContentResolver`` to build the content.

::

	output = Hello World
	output.if {
	  form_field_name_a = form_field_value_a_1
	  then = Hello Universe
	}

If the ``IfContentResolver`` produces any output, it will disable all other content resolvers on this configuration. All content resolvers that want to apply in this case, will have to be set in the ``then`` or ``else`` path of the ``if`` structure.
If the corresponding path (``then`` or ``else``) does not exist, the content resolver won't do anything.

::

	# In the example below the then-part does need to set insertData = 1 again,
	# because the outer configuration will be disabled completely.
	# Inside the if-structure there will also be no trimming, unless we set it there.

	output = Hello {name}
	output.insertData = 1
	output.if {
	    form_field_name_a = form_field_value_a_1
	    then = Hello {other_name}
	    then.insertData = 1
	}
	output.trim = 1

As usual we can nest the evaluations and content resolver however it suits us.

::

	output {
	  10 = Hello
	  10.if {
	    language = de
	    then = Hallo
	    else.if {
	      language = es
	      then = Hola
	    }
	  }
	  20.if {
	    form_field_name_a = form_field_value_a_1
	    then {
	      glue = \s
	      10 = Hello
	      20 = World
	      30.field = form_field_name_b
	      trim = 1
	    }
	    else {
	      10 = Foo
	      20.if {
	        form_field_name_c = form_field_value_c_1
	        else = foo {bar} baz
	        else.insertData = 1
	      }
	    }
	  }
	}

InsertDataContentResolver
*************************

This content resolver is modifying the result that is built by all content resolvers, that are involved.
It is going through all form fields ``form_field_name_x`` and is replacing all occurrences of the string ``{form_field_name_x}`` with the value of the form field.

Afterwards it will also remove all such placeholders ``{...}`` which were not replaced.

And it will replace all ``\s`` with the space character and all ``\n`` with a line break character.

::

	output = \s\s\sfoobar\s\s\s
	output.insertData = 1
	# result === "   foobar   "

::

	output = foo {bar} baz
	# result === "foo <value_of_field_bar> baz"

::

	output = foo{some_field_name_that_does_not_exist}bar
	output.insertData = 1
	# result === "foobar"

TrimContentResolver
*******************

This content resolver is modifying the result that is built ba yll content resolvers, that are involved.
It is trimming the result, removing all whitespace characters at the beginning and the end of the result.

::

	output = \s\s\sfoobar\s\s\s
	output.insertData = 1
	output.trim = 1
	# result === "foobar"
